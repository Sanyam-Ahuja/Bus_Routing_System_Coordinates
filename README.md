# ðŸšŒ Bus Route Optimizer (Coordinates + OR-Tools)

This project demonstrates solving a simplified **School Bus Routing Problem (SBRP)** using 
**Python + Google OR-Tools**, where student locations and school are represented as coordinates.

The program assigns students to buses (respecting bus capacities) and finds optimized routes 
that minimize the **total travel distance of all buses combined**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works

1. **Input Data**
   - `students.csv` contains student IDs, names, and their `(x, y)` coordinates.  
   - `buses.csv` contains bus IDs and their seating capacities.  
   - School is assumed to be at `(0,0)` (can be changed in code).

2. **Distance Matrix**
   - Euclidean distance is used between all points (school + students).  

3. **Optimization (VRP)**
   - OR-Tools `RoutingModel` solves the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)**.  
   - Students are assigned to buses.  
   - Each bus gets an optimized route.  
   - Objective: **minimize total distance across all buses**.

## ðŸ”¹ Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/bus-route-optimizer.git
   cd bus-route-optimizer/coordinates_version
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Run the Optimizer

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example Output

```
Bus 1 (Capacity 4)
Assigned Students: ['Amit', 'Simran', 'Rohit', 'Kabir']
Route: [(0, 0), (2.0, 3.0), (5.0, 4.0), (6.0, 2.0), (9.0, 3.0), (0, 0)]
Distance: 18.87 km

Bus 2 (Capacity 4)
Assigned Students: ['Meera', 'Sneha', 'Arjun', 'Riya']
Route: [(0, 0), (4.0, 9.0), (8.0, 6.0), (3.0, 8.0), (1.0, 7.0), (0, 0)]
Distance: 20.23 km

Total Distance (all buses): 39.10 km
```

## ðŸ”¹ Notes

- This version uses **coordinates only** (no APIs).  
- The school is hardcoded at `(0,0)` but can be changed in `main.py`.  
- Optimization minimizes **total distance**, not necessarily each bus individually.  
- OR-Tools ensures capacity constraints are respected.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

- Replace Euclidean distance with **real road distances** using Google Maps API or OpenRouteService (ORS).  
- Add traffic/time constraints.  
- Build a visualization (matplotlib routes on a map).
