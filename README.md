# ðŸšŒ Bus Route Optimizer (Coordinates + OR-Tools)

This project demonstrates solving a simplified **School Bus Routing Problem (SBRP)** using 
**Python + Google OR-Tools**, where student locations and school are represented as coordinates.

The program assigns students to buses (respecting bus capacities) and finds optimized routes 
that minimize the **total travel distance of all buses combined**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works

1. **Input Data**
   - `students.csv` contains student IDs, names, and their `(x, y)` coordinates.  
   - `buses.csv` contains bus IDs and their seating capacities.  
   - School is assumed to be at `(0,0)` (can be changed in code).

2. **Distance Matrix**
   - Euclidean distance is used between all points (school + students).  

3. **Optimization (VRP)**
   - OR-Tools `RoutingModel` solves the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)**.  
   - Students are assigned to buses.  
   - Each bus gets an optimized route.  
   - Objective: **minimize total distance across all buses**.
